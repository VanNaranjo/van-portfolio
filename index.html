                <h3><b>ABOUT ME: </b></h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently studying Computer Programming and Analysis at Fanshawe College while working as a Process Assistant at Amazon. I enjoy solving complex problems and collaborating with a team to find effective solutions. In my role at Amazon, I monitor and resolve issues that delivery drivers may encounter, ensuring successful deliveries by coordinating with various dispatchers. Additionally, I utilize Excel to create tools for data manipulation, which aids our daily operations and enhances efficiency. My experience at Amazon has honed my ability to manage logistics, analyze data, and streamline processes, all of which complement my academic pursuits and passion for technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a deep passion for learning new technologies and continuously enhancing my skills. My journey in the tech world is driven by curiosity and a desire to stay at the forefront of innovation. Currently, I am immersing myself in several programming languages to broaden my expertise and versatility as a developer. I am learning Java, a versatile and powerful language widely used in enterprise-level applications, Android development, and large systems, focusing on mastering object-oriented programming principles, data structures, and algorithms to build robust and efficient applications. I am also studying C++, known for its performance and control over system resources, and delving into advanced concepts like memory management, which is crucial in system programming, game development, and real-time processing applications. Additionally, I am exploring JavaScript, the cornerstone of web development, to create dynamic and interactive web applications, along with HTML and CSS to design and structure visually appealing websites. Lastly, I am learning Python, renowned for its simplicity and wide range of applications from web development to data science and machine learning, aiming to leverage its capabilities to solve complex problems and automate tasks efficiently.
